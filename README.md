**Constraints**

The robot should move on rope with stability and should be able to lift payload of at least 50 gms. Robot should be easy to carry i.e. it should fit within 20 * 20 * 20 cms dimensions and should not weigh more than 1 kgs. It should be user friendly. It should last for at least 3 hrs on a single charge. It should cover a distance of five meters over the rope in one run carrying the payload. The robot should not slip over from the sides and should keep the payload safe from any damage. It should also detect any obstacle in front of it and notify the user if it detects it and should stop the motion immediately. The controls given to the user should have an option of emergency stop and the robot should have a mechanism to stop the motion on pressing the stop button by the user. For easy access, the robot should be remotely controlled.
